## Project Ideas

### Website Color Palette Generator 
- Uses Colormind and ColourLovers APIs. User clicks generate and a simple demonstration webpage is displayed with a color scheme randomly chosen from Colormind and a hero pattern from ColourLovers. Users can save their favorite designs. Might be possible to get user input on patterns/colors they want to include, have to look at APIs further.
- User story: As a new developer/business, I want help with the basic color design of my website, so that my website looks coordinated and attractive.

### BuzzFeed Quiz
- (what APIs would we use?)
- User story: As someone who enjoys popular culture, I want a fun and interactive quiz, so I can enjoy content related to my interests.

### Fill in the Blank
- Generates a random popular quote with one word missing. User has to fill in missing word, keeps track of high scores. Lots of popular quote APIs available, not sure what second API would be.
- User story: As someone who enjoys games and works/travels, I want a simple mobile game, so I can enjoy down time when I'm not at home.

### Higher or Lower Game
- Could possibly use YouTube API (think it's free, we just need an API key). Displays a popular YouTube channel name and subscriber count on left column, on right column is another popular YouTube channel name with no subscriber count. User has to guess whether the account on the right has a higher or lower subscriber count than the channel on the left. If they guess correctly the channel on the right switches to the left and a new random popular channel displays on the right. Saves high scores.
- User story: As someone who enjoys games and works/travels, I want a simple mobile game, so I can enjoy down time when I'm not at home.

### Outside Health
- BreezoMeter Pollen and IQAir APIs. User enters city, app displays air quality, allergen info, and weather so the user can have a more comfortable time in their city/town. User can save a list of cities/towns for easy comparison.
- User story: As someone with allergies living in a polluted city, I want to know whether the outdoors is actively trying to harm me, so I know what days to limit outdoor exposure.

## Project Requirements
- Must use at least two server-side APIs
- Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap (Pure was our choice on Monday night)
- Must use client-side storage for persistent data
- Must have a polished, mobile-first UI
- Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
- Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals)
- Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)
