## How it works
Starting up a business and don't have access to a graphic designer? Color Coded is here to help! Simply click the generate button and a full color palette and hero image are created for use on your website. If you like a particular color from the palette, click on that color block to lock that color. Locked colors will stay (mostly) the same when new palettes are generated. Once you've found a design you're happy with, click the save button to add that palette and hero image to your saved palette list.

## Before you use
This application requires the use of a proxy server to properly handle http fetches on an https server. Before using our application, please visit [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and request temporary access to the demo server. Requesting temporary access whitelists your IP on the proxy server for up to a couple days - nothing is installed on your computer. A message with the cors-anywhere link will also display in the application if your IP hasn't been granted temporary access.
